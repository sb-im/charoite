# Config file for mosquitto

# See mosquitto.conf(5) for more information.

# This is a very basic configuration (no security etc - do not use in production!)
# If you are using this to replicate a bug please copy your own configuration in here (changing folders as necessary)

# For demonstration purposes we will not store messages to disk (the appropriate value depends upon what you are testing)
# Note: If enabled then you will probably want to add a bind to the docker-compose.yml so the persistence_file is retained.

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue per client
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 100. Set
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
# We do set this to 0 for testing because the default is may result in lost messages if there are a lot of
# messages waiting when the connection is re-established (they will all be sent immediately). This should not be
# 0 on a production system (but the value chosen should take into account likely queue sizes and bandwidth)
max_queued_messages 0
